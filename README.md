# rawhexdump

## TODO

- Comment **a lot** of stuff
- Check for style consistency
- Check execution time of screen refreshes
- Add file text buffer to fread a chunk of bytes, and then read from there (avoiding many fread() and malloc()/free())
- Implement bar with commands on the bottom line of the terminal
